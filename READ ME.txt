ZOEY, YOUR SMART VOICE ASSISTNAT:

INTRODUCTION:
Hey, I have perfected my voice assistant further to give her a name "Zoey", and to improve the accuracy of the Tasks that she can perform, I have added a few new features such as Text To Speech, Volume control and Forward and Back in Gesture Based Media Control, Daily Status with Time, Date, Day and year and much more.

INSTRUCTIONS:
I have made it incredibly easy to use this program, you don't have to add your own Directories anymore, I have removed the file opening for just one single file, and the Media control is just for Netflix and YouTube, you can add other media choices if you would like:

STEPS:
1.Download Python
2.Open Terminal
3.Type : pip install ______ (name of libraries here)
	Libaries: 
		speechrecognition

4.Locate your python file in Terminal with cd and directory of your python file
5.Type python voiceassistant.py
6.Speak when you say Listening.. say "Introcuce Yourself"
7.Enjoy ^^
